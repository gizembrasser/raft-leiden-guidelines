The second requirement is that ##begin_quote##A video and its associated transcripts and translations must be seen as forming integral parts of the same evidence.##end_quote## This means that any transcripts or translations of the video are considered part of the evidence and should be included.  The third requirement is that ##begin_quote##Videos not in a working language of the Court should be translated into one of the working languages of the Court and made available to the Chamber and all parties within the time limit fixed by the Chamber.##end_quote## This means that if the video is not in a language that the court uses, it must be translated.  The fourth requirement is that ##begin_quote##When a witness appears on a video that the party intends to tender into evidence, the video should be tendered through the witness during the examination-in-chief and not through the bar table.##end_quote## This means that if a witness is in the video, the video should be presented during that witness's main examination.  The fifth requirement is that ##begin_quote##The Court can make an inference from the content of a video to the extent that it allows the Court to make a definite finding.##end_quote## This means that the court can draw conclusions from the video if it helps them make a clear decision.  The sixth requirement is that ##begin_quote##Videos can be admitted into evidence if relevance and prima facie authenticity is demonstrated by providing information about the date, the location, the events depicted, the author, the source, and/or the chain of custody.##end_quote## This means that the video must be relevant and appear to be authentic, and information about when and where it was taken, what it shows, who made it, where it came from, and how it was handled must be provided.  The seventh requirement is that ##begin_quote##Video evidence of interviews conducted during an armed conflict by a party to the conflict may not be objective and reliable and therefore low probative value may be attached to the video.##end_quote## This means that videos of interviews conducted during an armed conflict may not be considered reliable or objective.

If not in a working language of the Court, it should be translated. If a witness appears in the video, it should be tendered through the witness during the examination-in-chief. The Court should be able to make a definite finding from the video content. The video's relevance and prima facie authenticity should be demonstrated by providing information about the date, location, events depicted, author, source, and/or chain of custody.
