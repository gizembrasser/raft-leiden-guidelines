The proportionality of the collection of the CDRs is assessed with \nreference to a number of factors. I n Bemba et al , the collection of CDRs was held by the ICC \nTrial Chamber to be proportionate because they only concerned non -privileged calls and not \ncalls that were protected by attorney -client privilege.271 In concluding that the transfer of CDRs \nwas propo rtionate, the STL Trial Chamber in Ayyash et al  considered the gravity of the attack \nunder investigation, the overall unstable security situation, and the fact that the investigation \nwas conducted pursuant to a UN Security Council Resolution under Chapter VII of the UN \nCharter;272 and it noted that access to the CDRs was strictly limited to individuals who had \nprofessional and ethical obligations of confidentiality, thus minimising the intrusion to any right \nto privacy.273 \n \n270 Prosecutor v Ayyash et al  (Decision on Five Prosecution Motions on Call Sequence Tables and Eight \nWitness Statements and on the Legality of the Transfer of Call Data Records to UNIIIC a nd STL\u2019s \nProsecution ) STL -11-01\/T\/TC (6 May 2015) (TC) [103], [109].  \n271 Prosecutor v Bemba et al  (Decision on Bemba and Arido Defence Requests to Declare Certain \nMaterials Inadmissible ) ICC-01\/05 -01\/13 -1432 (30 October 2015) (TC VII) [17].  \n<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT> \n11 granted the Prosecution\u2019s request to admit extensions of video excerpts that had been \ntendered by the Defence in order to illustrate the reason behind the presence  of community \nleaders at an event depicted in the video excerpts.34  \n \nA.2.

First, the video should be tendered through the witness during the examination-in-chief and not through the bar table. This is mentioned in the context as ##begin_quote##\"When a witness appears on a video that the party intends to tender into evidence, the video should be tendered through the witness during the examination-in-chief and not through the bar table.\"##end_quote##\n\nNext, the party presenting the video must establish that the witness has personal knowledge of the making of the recording or its contents. This can be done by playing a brief excerpt of the video for the witness to confirm their personal knowledge of it. This is stated in the context as ##begin_quote##\"If a party wishes to present a video to a witness, it must first establish that the witness has personal knowledge of the making of said recording or its contents.

The Guidelines are aimed at legal practitioners and have \nbeen designe d to be practical and easily accessible whilst also being sufficiently detailed and \nsubstantiated. A subsidiary goal of the Leiden Guidelines is knowledge management: \nrecognising that DDE represents a developing area of legal practice, the Leiden Guideline s \nwere designed to be flexible enough to accommodate future developments within its existing \nframework and structure.  \n \nA.

Relevance of intercepts, which are not in a working language of the \nCourt, may not be assessed when there is no relevant and accurate translation. \nNot all mistakes in translations or transcripts are material or affect the \nsubstance and understanding of the  document.  \nKeywords: relevance; probative value; prejudice; translation; transcription  \nThe relevance of an intercept cannot be demonstrated if there is no translation available. The \nICTY Trial Chamber in Tolimir held that since there was no English transla tion uploaded to the \neCourt system, the Court was unable to assess the relevance of two intercepts.180 \n Transcripts and Translations of Detention Center Intercepts by the Defence or \nProsecutor instead of a Third Party.  Transcripts and translations of conver sations from the \nCourt\u2019s Detention Centre carried out by a party to the case does not inherently make them \ninadmissible.181 The ICC Appeals Chamber in Bemba et al established this as a well -known fact, \nand rejected the Defence\u2019s argument that the Chamber er red when relying on transcripts and \ntranslations provided by the Prosecutor, \u2018a biased party to the proceedings, affecting its \nassessment of the recordings from the Detention Centre in its entirety.\u2019182 The Appeals \nChamber held that the Office of the Prosec utor (OTP)\u2019s role in the transcriptions and \ntranslations was \u2018not in itself a reason not to take them into account\u2019 and the parties could still \nchallenge the accuracy of the transcription and translation.183  \n Accuracy of Translation.  An intercept can be te ndered once the Prosecution and the \nDefence agree about the accuracy of the text of its transcript and translation.184 In Mladi \u0107, the \nTrial Chamber confirmed that even if the parties disagree on how to interpret the words \nspoken, this does not deprive the i ntercepted conversations of their relevance for the case. \n \n180 Prosecutor v Tolimir  (Decision on Prosecution\u2019s Motion for Admission of 28 Intercepts from the Bar \nTable ) IT-05-88\/2 -T (20 J anuary 2012) (TC II) [13].  \n<\/DOCUMENT>\nWhat is the case number for Prosecutor v Krsti\u0107?"}

Moreover, it remains open to \nthe Defence to challenge their authenticity.175 \nWitness Testimony.  Judges may have a prima facie basis to admit intercepts and their  \ntranscripts where their authenticity and chain of custody can be demonstrated through witness \ntestimony by the person who intercepted the communication. The witness must be able to \ntestify that they recognise the intercept and its transcripts, and that th ey are able to identify it \nas the same one they had recorded.176 The ICTR Trial Chamber in Renzaho  found that the tape \nof an intercepted phone call (recorded by a journalist),177 on which the accused allegedly talked \nof \u2018extermination\u2019, could be admitted. The Defence argued that it was not known how the \nintercept was made and where it originally came from, and this therefore cast \u2018doubt and \nambiguity as to the authenticity of [the ] tapes\u2019.178 In response, the ICTR Trial Chamber \nconsidered the testimony of the journalist, who testified that he recognised the intercept and \nits transcript when this was shown to him during examination -in-chief, and he was also able to \nidentify that the intercept in question was the same as the one he had made in 1994.

Intercepts are more likely to be dee med reliable by a \nCourt when they can be authenticated, cross checked and corroborated through internal \nmeans such as multiple operators intercepting the same message.167 The authenticity and \nreliability of the communication is supported by the fact that two or more intercept operators \nhave monitored the same conversation, with only slight or no variations from each other.168 \nThis also applies when operators work from diffe rent locations.169 This was  found to be the \ncase by two different ICTY Trial Chambers , in Krsti \u0107 and Blagojevi \u0107 and Joki \u0107, when single \nconversations were monitored by different intercept operators from different locations.170 \nConsequently, where corroboratin g evidence is of a high level of documentable detail that \ncould not have been completely manufactured, it is more likely the intercept evidence will be \naccepted as reliable.  \n Forensic Reports.  An intercept whose authenticity cannot be confirmed with certai nty \nmay nevertheless be admitted if a forensic report states that there are no traces of it having \nbeen tampered with.171 The ICTY Trial Chamber in \u017dupljanin found that, while a forensic report \nanalysing a telephone intercept of a conversation had clearly s aid that its authenticity could \nnot be confirmed with any degree of full certainty, the report did observe that there were no \ntraces of it having been tampered with.

Intercepts are more likely to be dee med reliable by a \nCourt when they can be authenticated, cross checked and corroborated through internal \nmeans such as multiple operators intercepting the same message.167 The authenticity and \nreliability of the communication is supported by the fact that two or more intercept operators \nhave monitored the same conversation, with only slight or no variations from each other.168 \nThis also applies when operators work from diffe rent locations.169 This was  found to be the \ncase by two different ICTY Trial Chambers , in Krsti \u0107 and Blagojevi \u0107 and Joki \u0107, when single \nconversations were monitored by different intercept operators from different locations.170 \nConsequently, where corroboratin g evidence is of a high level of documentable detail that \ncould not have been completely manufactured, it is more likely the intercept evidence will be \naccepted as reliable.  \n Forensic Reports.
