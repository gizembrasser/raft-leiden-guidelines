C.3. ","assistant: To answer the question, we need to look at the section of the context that specifically discusses the requirements for a video to be admitted into evidence according to the Leiden Guidelines. This information is found under the heading ""A. VIDEOS"" in the context provided.

The first requirement is that ##begin_quote##Instead of excerpts, videos should be submitted in their entirety.##end_quote## This means that the full video, not just selected parts, should be presented.

The second requirement is that ##begin_quote##A video and its associated transcripts and translations must be seen as forming integral parts of the same evidence.##end_quote## This means that any transcripts or translations of the video are considered part of the evidence and should be included.

The third requirement is that ##begin_quote##Videos not in a working language of the Court should be translated into one of the working languages of the Court and made available to the Chamber and all parties within the time limit fixed by the Chamber.##end_quote## This means that if the video is not in a language that the court uses, it must be translated.

The fourth requirement is that ##begin_quote##When a witness appears on a video that the party intends to tender into evidence, the video should be tendered through the witness during the examination-in-chief and not through the bar table.##end_quote## This means that if a witness is in the video, the video should be presented during that witness's main examination.

The fifth requirement is that ##begin_quote##The Court can make an inference from the content of a video to the extent that it allows the Court to make a definite finding.##end_quote## This means that the court can draw conclusions from the video if it helps them make a clear decision.

The sixth requirement is that ##begin_quote##Videos can be admitted into evidence if relevance and prima facie authenticity is demonstrated by providing information about the date, the location, the events depicted, the author, the source, and/or the chain of custody.##end_quote## This means that the video must be relevant and appear to be authentic, and information about when and where it was taken, what it shows, who made it, where it came from, and how it was handled must be provided.

The seventh requirement is that ##begin_quote##Video evidence of interviews conducted during an armed conflict by a party to the conflict may not be objective and reliable and therefore low probative value may be attached to the video.##end_quote## This means that videos of interviews conducted during an armed conflict may not be considered reliable or objective.

The eighth requirement is that ##begin_quote##The consent of witnesses and others affected by the work of the Court whose image is depicted in video evidence is required.##end_quote## This means that anyone shown in the video must give their consent for it to be used.

<ANSWER>: According to the Leiden Guidelines, for a video to be admitted into evidence, it should be submitted in its entirety, along with its associated transcripts and translations. If not in a working language of the Court, it should be translated. If a witness appears in the video, it should be tendered through the witness during the examination-in-chief. The Court should be able to make a definite finding from the video content. The video's relevance and prima facie authenticity should be demonstrated by providing information about the date, location, events depicted, author, source, and/or chain of custody. Videos of interviews conducted during an armed conflict may not be considered reliable or objective. Finally, the consent of those depicted in the video is required.","<DOCUMENT>110 Prosecutor v Bemba  (Public Re dacted Decision on the Prosecution's Requests to Lift, Maintain and

20 B. Photographs  
Definition  
Photographs are widely used within international criminal proceedings, but despite their 
common usage, courts and tribunals have not undertaken to provide a widespread defi nition 
at this stage. Photographs often fall under the broad definition of documentary evidence which 
includes ‘anything in which information of any description is recorded’91 and can be defined as 
‘picture[s] made using a camera, in which an image is focu sed on to light -sensitive material and 
then made visible and permanent by chemical treatment, or stored digitally’.92 
 
B.1. The Court can make an inference from the content of a photograph to 
the extent that it allows the Court to make a definite finding.  
Keywo rds: relevance; inferences  
This Guideline is derived from the ICC’s treatment of video evidence, but it can reasonably be 
applied to photographs as well. Caution should be exercised when considering a photograph 
since differences in personal perception can cause difficulties in making a definite finding.93 
The Court will rely on the photograph only to the extent that it can make such a definite 
finding.94 The ICC Trial Chamber in Lubanga found that a reliable distinction can be drawn 
between i ndividuals of different ages, based solely on the individuals’ appearance.95 Pursuant 
to Rule 63(4) of the ICC Rules of Procedure and Evidence , there is no strict legal requirement 
that a photograph has to be corroborated by other evidence for the Court to be able to rely on 
it and establish a specific fact.96

3 I. Introductio n 
Digitally Derived Evidence (DDE) is increasingly used in international criminal courts and 
tribunals to prosecute perpetrators of international crimes. Advanced digital tools, including 
aerial photography, mobile devices, video, intercepted communications, amongst others, 
capture new and vast quantities of data, which can add supplementary and supporting data to 
existing evidence. </DOCUMENT>

21 B.2. Photographs can be admitted into evidence if prima facie authenticity 
is demonstrated by providing information about the date, the location, the 
events depicted, the author, the source, and/or the chain of c ustody.  
Keywords: probative value; relevance; authenticity; chain of custody; admissibility  
Based on Article 69(4) of the Rome Statute  and Rules 63 and 64 of the ICC Rules of Procedure 
and Evidence , regarding the Court’s authority to rule on the relevance, probative value and 
admissibility of any evidence, photographs should be a ccompanied by reliable information on 
their date, location and events depicted. If the Court does not receive such information, 
photographs’ relevance to issues in the case and probative value cannot be determined.97 The 
ICC Trial Chamber in Ntaganda noted  that since six photographs brought by the Prosecution 
were not dated, their relevance and probative value surrounding issues in the case could not 
be determined.98 It added that when photographs are dated, the parties seeking admission 
should provide evid ence from which the Court can conclude that the dates are correct and fall 
within the temporal scope of the charges.99 The ICC Trial Chamber in Ntaganda also noted that 
certain dated photographs could have some relevance, including photos dated ambiguously  
(such as ‘08/07 2003’ , which could  be interpreted as  either the  8th of July or August 7th) or by 
a range (‘January -February 2003’), but in the absence of any further reliable information as to 
the date, location and events depicted in the photographs, it could not admit them into 
evidence due to lack of probative value.100  
Likewise, the ICTR Trial Chamber in Karamera found that a photographic piece of 
evidence did not have sufficient indicia of authenticity as it did not contain any reliable 
information: for example, it did not bear any official stamp, signature, seal, date, nor was there 
any co rroborating evidence, indication of the chain of custody and/or information regarding 
the author. The Trial Chamber thus found the origin of the photograph doubtful.101 The ICC

Prosecutor v Oussama Achraf Akhlafa  ECLI:EN:RBDHA:2019:7430, the Dutch District Court in The Hague 
noted that “determining the date on which a particular image was taken is potentially an interesting 
element in the context of a crim inal investigation”. Though it does not establish it as a guideline, it does 
mirror the importance of photographic evidence being dated.

D. Scope of the Leiden Guidelines  
The rules and practice surrounding the use of DDE in international criminal courts and tribunals 
continue to develop. Digital technology is being used more widely and frequently, not only in 
the investigation and prosecution of international crimes, but also in their commission. It 
follows that clearer and more comprehens ive discussion of DDE -related considerations is 
produced as cases proceed to trial. However, this process has not yet occurred in relation to 
some specific categories of DDE, such that the authors were unable to draw meaningful or 
authoritative guidelines from the practice of the international criminal courts and tribunals. 
Accordingly, the Guidelines do not cover the use of social media posts or emails as types of 
DDE in international criminal proceedings:  
Social Media Posts.  Social media posts have been u sed in international criminal 
proceedings. The ICC Trial Chamber in Bemba et al  admitted screenshots of social media 
profiles,21 while the Defence in Taylor  were permitted to show a social media post to a 
witness22 and had the social media post marked for identification.23 More recently, the Al-
Werfalli  case is significant in terms of social media evidence,24 as the ICC Pre-Trial Chamber 
based its findings on, inter alia , social media posts.25 However, none of the Chambers discussed 
the admissibility of soc ial media evidence or specific evidentiary requirements and as such, no 
authoritative guidelines could be reasonably deduced or formulated.  
Emails.  Emails have also been tendered as evidence in international criminal 
proceedings. The MICT Trial Chamber in Nzabonimpa et al  admitted and relied upon emails as

D. Scope of the Leiden Guidelines  
The rules and practice surrounding the use of DDE in international criminal courts and tribunals 
continue to develop. Digital technology is being used more widely and frequently, not only in 
the investigation and prosecution of international crimes, but also in their commission. It 
follows that clearer and more comprehens ive discussion of DDE -related considerations is 
produced as cases proceed to trial. However, this process has not yet occurred in relation to 
some specific categories of DDE, such that the authors were unable to draw meaningful or 
authoritative guidelines from the practice of the international criminal courts and tribunals. 
Accordingly, the Guidelines do not cover the use of social media posts or emails as types of 
DDE in international criminal proceedings:  
Social Media Posts.  Social media posts have been u sed in international criminal 
proceedings. The ICC Trial Chamber in Bemba et al  admitted screenshots of social media 
profiles,21 while the Defence in Taylor  were permitted to show a social media post to a 
witness22 and had the social media post marked for identification.23 More recently, the Al-
Werfalli  case is significant in terms of social media evidence,24 as the ICC Pre-Trial Chamber 
based its findings on, inter alia , social media posts.25 However, none of the Chambers discussed 
the admissibility of soc ial media evidence or specific evidentiary requirements and as such, no 
authoritative guidelines could be reasonably deduced or formulated.  
Emails.  Emails have also been tendered as evidence in international criminal 
proceedings. The MICT Trial Chamber in Nzabonimpa et al  admitted and relied upon emails as 
 
20 cf The narrower provisions which do not stipulate the norm which must be violated: Rule 95 of the 
ICTY  and ICTR  Rules of Procedure and Evidence, Rule  117 of the IRMCT Rules of Procedure and 
Evidence , Rule 162 of the STL Rules of Procedure and Evidence .

 ","assistant: To answer the question, we need to look at the context provided which discusses the procedure for tendering video excerpts in court according to the ICC Trial Chamber in Ntaganda.

From this, we can infer that if a party wants to tender excerpts of a video in court, they should clearly state if the full footage is available and who extracted the segments of the video. Additionally, the opposing party has the right to tender additional excerpts to help the court understand the context of the segments that are being admitted.

","assistant: Step 1: Identify the key information in the question. The question is asking about the relationship between a video and its associated transcripts and translations in a court case.

Step 2: Look for relevant information in the context. The context provides detailed information about how a video and its associated transcripts and translations are treated in a court case.

Step 3: Extract the relevant information from the context. The context states, ##begin_quote##""A video and its associated transcripts and translations must be seen as forming integral parts of the same evidence.

Step 4: Formulate the answer based on the extracted information. The relationship between a video and its associated transcripts and translations in a court case is that they are all seen as integral parts of the same evidence. The transcripts and translations are written records that reflect the contents of the video for better comprehension. When a video is formally submitted as evidence, it automatically includes the formal submission of its associated transcripts and translations.

","assistant: Reasoning:

The question asks about the procedure for translating and transcribing videos in court according to the ICTY Trial Chamber in Mladić. The context provides information on this procedure. 

Firstly, the context mentions that videos devoid of translation and transcription can be initially translated and transcribed by counsel, as long as they are done accurately. This is stated in the sentence: ##begin_quote##""Videos adduced from other sources and devoid of translation and transcription can be initially translated and transcribed by counsel, so long as they are translated and transcribed with accuracy.""##end_quote##

Secondly, the context mentions that the videos should be translated afterwards by a third party, such as an impartial translator. This is stated in the sentence: ##begin_quote##""The videos should be translated afterwards by a third party (for example, an impartial translator)""##end_quote##

Lastly, the context mentions that the translations should be submitted by the time limit fixed by the Chamber in order to be deemed admissible. This is stated in the sentence: ##begin_quote##""Pursuant to Regulation 34 of the Regulations of the Court , the translations should be submitted by the time limit fixed by the Chamber in order to be deemed admissible.""##end_quote##

Answer: 

The procedure for translating and transcribing videos in court according to the ICTY Trial Chamber in Mladić involves initially translating and transcribing the videos by counsel with accuracy, then having the videos translated by a third party such as an impartial translator, and finally submitting the translations by the time limit fixed by the Chamber to be deemed admissible.","<DOCUMENT> 
13 the Trial Chamber ultimately found that the video did not bear ‘sufficient probative value for 
admission’.49 
 Translation by Counsel.  Videos adduced from other sources and devoid of translation 
and transcription can be initially translated and transcribed by counsel, so long as they are 
translated and transcribed with accuracy. The videos should be translated afterwards by a third 
party  (for example, an impartial translator);50 the ICTY Trial Chamber in Mladi ć allowed Defence 
counsel to initially transcribe and translate a video of two film crews visiting a humanitarian 
refugee centre.51 
Time Limits. Pursuant to Regulation 34 of the Regulations of the Court , the translations 
should be submitted by the time limit fixed by the Chamber in order to be deemed admissible. 
The interest of the Court in receiving the transcripts and translations after the time limit in 
order to understand the original videos may outweigh their late submission.52 Limited 
resources and the amount of labour required can constitute ‘good cause’ for the extension of 
a time limit under t he first part of Regulation 35(2) of the Regulations of the Court . However, 
after the lapse of a time limit, the fact that transcription and translation are time consuming  is 
not considered an exceptional circumstance for an extension of the time limit under the second 
part of Regulation 35(2).53 A video may be disclosed after the time limit to substitute the 
segments that overlap with a previously disclosed video if it is of superior quality but the Court 
may not admit additional material that does not overlap if the party does not justify late 
disclosure under Regulation 35(2).54

","assistant: Reasoning:

The procedure for presenting a video as evidence in court involves several steps. First, the video should be tendered through the witness during the examination-in-chief and not through the bar table. This is mentioned in the context as ##begin_quote##""When a witness appears on a video that the party intends to tender into evidence, the video should be tendered through the witness during the examination-in-chief and not through the bar table.""##end_quote##

Next, the party presenting the video must establish that the witness has personal knowledge of the making of the recording or its contents. This can be done by playing a brief excerpt of the video for the witness to confirm their personal knowledge of it. This is stated in the context as ##begin_quote##""If a party wishes to present a video to a witness, it must first establish that the witness has personal knowledge of the making of said recording or its contents.

Finally, the video will not be considered for the truth of its contents unless it is admitted into evidence. This is mentioned in the context as ##begin_quote##""The video will not be considered for the truth of its contents unless it is admitted into evidence, even if the video was presented to the witness.""##end_quote##

Once the video's authenticity has been established, it may be admitted as real evidence. If parts of the video are found to be inadmissible, the rest of the video may still be admissible.

If segments of a video are found to be inadmissible, the remainder of the information in the video may nevertheless be found to be admissible.""##end_quote##

<ANSWER>: The procedure for presenting a video as evidence in court involves tendering the video through the witness during the examination-in-chief, establishing that the witness has personal knowledge of the video by playing a brief excerpt, and admitting the video into evidence. Once the video's authenticity is established, it may be admitted as real evidence, and even if parts of the video are inadmissible, the rest of the video may still be admissible.","<DOCUMENT>For example, while an eyewitness account may provide relev ant information

digital evidence may become the primary ev idence upon which some convictions are based.

relating to DDE before t he international criminal courts and tribunals.  
The Leiden Guidelines  on the Use of Digitally Derived Evidence in International Criminal Courts and 
Tribunals  (“The Leiden Guidelines”)  are intended to assist practitioners by comprehensively 
outlining the essential elements which should be considered before submitting DDE to an 
international criminal court or tribunal. The Guidelines are aimed at legal practitioners and have

Step 2: Look for relevant information in the context. The context discusses the relevance of a video, the need for precise details about the date, time, and location of the video, the requirement for the Defence to fully understand the contents of the video, and the need for prima facie authenticity to be demonstrated.

Step 3: Extract the necessary information from the context. 

##begin_quote##
The relevance of a video depends on the date, time, and/or location of its recording. As such, the date, time, and location of the video must be stated as precisely as possible. A video is only disclosed from the moment the Defence can fully understand what its exact content is.
##end_quote##

##begin_quote##
Prima facie authenticity must be demonstrated before videos can be admitted into evidence. This may be indicated by providing information about the date, the author, the source, and/or the chain of custody. In contrast, if the tendering party fails to provide any substantiation of, for example, the time when a video was shot, the video may be considered to have low probative value which might be outweighed by the prejudice that admission of the video would cause, resulting in the video not being admissible.
##end_quote##

Step 4: Formulate the answer based on the extracted information. The factors considered for a video to be admissible as evidence in court include the date, time, and location of its recording, the Defence's understanding of its content, and its prima facie authenticity, which can be demonstrated by providing information about the date, the author, the source, and the chain of custody.

provide contextual evidence on its chain of custod y, including evidence on the creation, 
storage, and retrieval of the CDRs.250 The CDRs themselves may also have inherent indicia of

 Reliability of CSTs.  The tendering party must also provide contextual evidence about 
the CSTs, particularly on how they were produced.253 Tendered CSTs must be accompanied by 
witness statements or testim ony about who prepared the CSTs and in what manner.254 In 
Ayyash et al , STL Prosecution analysts described the process of creating the CSTs from the 
CDRs, including the method used, the peer review process, and the correction of errors in the 
CSTs; and a Pr osecution administrator testified about receiving, storing, and processing raw 
call data and the design, implementation, maintenance, and repair of a database used for the 
analysis of the CDRs.255 
When the call data is tendered together with, and in relatio n to, intercepted

raise particular concerns about the human right to privacy, as will be discussed in greater detail

D. Scope of the Leiden Guidelines  
The rules and practice surrounding the use of DDE in international criminal courts and tribunals 
continue to develop. Digital technology is being used more widely and frequently, not only in 
the investigation and prosecution of international crimes, but also in their commission. It 
follows that clearer and more comprehens ive discussion of DDE -related considerations is 
produced as cases proceed to trial. However, this process has not yet occurred in relation to 
some specific categories of DDE, such that the authors were unable to draw meaningful or 
authoritative guidelines from the practice of the international criminal courts and tribunals. 
Accordingly, the Guidelines do not cover the use of social media posts or emails as types of 
DDE in international criminal proceedings:  
Social Media Posts.  Social media posts have been u sed in international criminal 
proceedings. The ICC Trial Chamber in Bemba et al  admitted screenshots of social media 
profiles,21 while the Defence in Taylor  were permitted to show a social media post to a 
witness22 and had the social media post marked for identification.23 More recently, the Al-
Werfalli  case is significant in terms of social media evidence,24 as the ICC Pre-Trial Chamber 
based its findings on, inter alia , social media posts.25 However, none of the Chambers discussed 
the admissibility of soc ial media evidence or specific evidentiary requirements and as such, no 
authoritative guidelines could be reasonably deduced or formulated.  
Emails.  Emails have also been tendered as evidence in international criminal

includes ‘anything in which information of any description is recorded’91 and can be defined as

20 B. Photographs  
Definition  
Photographs are widely used within international criminal proceedings, but despite their 
common usage, courts and tribunals have not undertaken to provide a widespread defi nition 
at this stage. Photographs often fall under the broad definition of documentary evidence which 
includes ‘anything in which information of any description is recorded’91 and can be defined as 
‘picture[s] made using a camera, in which an image is focu sed on to light -sensitive material and 
then made visible and permanent by chemical treatment, or stored digitally’.92 
 
B.1. The Court can make an inference from the content of a photograph to 
the extent that it allows the Court to make a definite finding.  
Keywo rds: relevance; inferences  
This Guideline is derived from the ICC’s treatment of video evidence, but it can reasonably be 
applied to photographs as well. Caution should be exercised when considering a photograph 
since differences in personal perception can cause difficulties in making a definite finding.93 
The Court will rely on the photograph only to the extent that it can make such a definite 
finding.94 The ICC Trial Chamber in Lubanga found that a reliable distinction can be drawn 
between i ndividuals of different ages, based solely on the individuals’ appearance.95 Pursuant 
to Rule 63(4) of the ICC Rules of Procedure and Evidence , there is no strict legal requirement 
that a photograph has to be corroborated by other evidence for the Court to be able to rely on 
it and establish a specific fact.96

24 C. Aerial and Satellite Images  
Definition  
Although Courts and Tribunals do not provide a standard ised definition of this type of DDE, 
the term ‘satellite images’ has been used to describe digitally transmitted images taken by 
artificial satellites orbiting the Earth115 and the term ‘aerial images’ has been used to describe 
images taken from the sky by aircrafts or drones (also known as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles 
(UAVs).116 
 
C.1. Where forensic evidence including aerial and satellite images is 
voluminous, it may be entered into evidence via expert reports summarising 
the forensic evidence.  
Keywords: procedure; e xperts; forensic evidence; summary report  
Pursuant to Rule 92 bis (A) of the ICTY Rules of Procedure and Evidence , evidence of a witness 
in the form of a written statement may be admitted in lieu of oral testimony which goes to 
proof of a matter other than the acts and conduct of an accused as charged in the indictment. 
An example of the rule’s application would be if evidence in question is of a cumulative nature 
in that other witnesses will give, or have given, oral testimony of similar facts. This allows 
investigators to produce summary reports which are derived from multiple sources and aims 
to give background evidence to the forensic examinati ons, thereby contextualising and 
reducing the apparent complexity of their findings.117 ‘To facilitate matters and to speed up the 
process’,118 the ICTY in Krsti ć authorised an investigator with the Office of the Prosecutor to 
testify in a summary form about  the findings of forensic experts who had conducted 
examinations of various grave sites in 1996, 1998 and 1999 ‘associated with the take -over of 
Srebrenica’.119

29 D. Intercepts  
Definition  
Intercepts fall under documentary evidence a nd can be characterised as ‘anything in which 
information of any description is recorded.’147 Intercepts are audio communications 
intercepted using technical equipment148 which are transcribed into writing, audiotapes  or any 
other type of digital records.149 
 
D.1. Intercepts can be tendered from the bar table if they are relevant and 
probative, and can be used to reduce the number of witnesses required, and/or 
corroborate other intercepts.  
Keywords: procedure; relevance; probative value; bar table; witnesses  
Pursu ant to Rule 89(C) of the ICTY Rules of Procedure and Evidence ,150 ‘a Chamber may admit 
any relevant evidence which it deems to have probative value’. I n Mladi ć, the ICTY Trial 
Chamber found that admission of intercepts from the bar table requires that the Prosecution 
show the tendered material be relevant and probative, and that it fit into the case. As the 
Chamber had already taken judicial notice of th e authenticity of the intercepts seized from the 
Mladi ć family residence, their relevance was established. Their probative value was enhanced 
by the fact that they had been recovered by the Serbian authorities. The absence of direct and 
precise time and da te references did not deprive them of their relevance and probative value, 
although the Trial Chamber noted that additional evidentiary efforts may be required to give 
the intercepts the full weight that could be afforded to them.151 
Witnesses.  Pursuant to Rule 65 ter (E)(i) and (ii) of the ICTY Rules of Procedure and 
Evidence ,152 a pre -trial judge may order the Prosecutor to file the final v ersion of the

","assistant: Step 1: Identify the relevant information in the context that directly answers the question. The question asks about the conditions for admissibility of aerial and satellite images as part of a witness's testimony according to the ICTY Rules of Procedure and Evidence. The context provides several conditions for this.

Step 2: Extract the relevant information from the context. The context states: ##begin_quote##""Aerial and satellite images admitted during former witness testimony are admissible if they form an inseparable and indispensable part of that testimony.""##end_quote## This means that the images must be crucial to the testimony and cannot be separated from it.

Step 3: Further extract additional conditions from the context. The context also states: ##begin_quote##""Aerial and satellite images are an inseparable and indispensable part of the testimony if the witness discusses them ‘in his or her written statement or transcript and if that written statement would become incomprehensible or have lesser probative value without [the] admission’ of such images.""##end_quote## This means that the images must be discussed in the witness's written statement or transcript, and the statement would be less understandable or have less evidential value without the images.

Step 4: Note any additional requirements. The context mentions that the images should be tendered with an index indicating the exact title or exhibit number for each former exhibit. Also, for former expert testimony, the images are admissible if the testimony is highly relevant to the case and is open to cross-examination by the Defence.

<ANSWER>: The conditions for aerial and satellite images to be admissible as part of a witness's testimony according to the ICTY Rules of Procedure and Evidence are: 1) the images must form an inseparable and indispensable part of the testimony, 2) the witness must discuss the images in their written statement or transcript, 3) the written statement would become incomprehensible or have lesser probative value without the images, 4) the images should be tendered with an index indicating the exact title or exhibit number for each former exhibit, and 5) for former expert testimony, the images are admissible if the testimony is highly relevant to the case and is open to cross-examination by the Defence.","<DOCUMENT>8 Cf.

Pursuant to Rule 92 bis (D) of the ICTY Rules of Procedure and Evidence ,120 ‘a Chamber may 
admit a transcript of evidence given by a witness in proceedings before the Tribunal which 
goes to proof of a matter other than the acts and conduct of the accused’. Although Rule 92 
bis (D) does not  explicitly provide for the admission of exhibits admitted during former 
testimony, these exhibits are admissible pursuant to this rule so long as they form an 
inseparable and indispensable part of the testimony (whether expert or not).121 Aerial and 
satell ite images are an inseparable and indispensable part of the testimony if the witness 
discusses them ‘in his or her written statement or transcript and if that written statement would 
become incomprehensible or have lesser probative value without [the] admi ssion’ of such 
images.122  
Indexes.  Aerial and satellite images admitted during former witness testimony should 
be tendered with an  index. The index should indicate the exact title or exhibit number for each 
former exhibit to identify the exact exhibits from the previous case.123 The ICTY in Blagojevi ć 
and Joki ć postponed the admission of aerial images that had been previously tendered and 
admitted at the ICTY during related witness testimony of previous ICTY trials until an index of 
proposed exhi bits could be provided.124 
Former Expert Testimony.  Further considerations apply to former expert testimony: 
aerial and satellite images attached to former expert testimony are admissible if such testimony 
is also highly relevant to the case and is open to cross -examination by the Defence. Pursuant 
to Rule  94 bis of the ICTY Rules of Procedure and Evidence ,125 it should be determined whether

Insufficient authentication goes to the weight of aerial and satellite \nimages rather than their admissibility.  \nKeywords: probative value; admissibility; relevance; authentication; chain of custody  \nManipulation and distortion of aerial and satellite images do not necessarily affect their \nadmissibility.136 The ICTY in Popovi ć disagreed with the Defence’s argument that the aerial \nimages in that case could not be admitted because their dates had been removed, they ‘were \nmisrepresented to the Uni ted Nations, the Security Council, and the public’ as proving the \npurported existence of weapons of mass destruction was unrelated to the case, and there were \ndifferences in corroborating testimony:137 such reasons go to weight (i.e., probative value) \nrathe r than the criteria necessary for admission.138 \n Method of Creation.

Keywords: relevance; corroboration  
Aerial and satellite images can be used to corroborate other evidence such as forensic 
evidence,132 witness testimony,133 and the reliability of intercept communications.134 The ICTY 
in Krsti ć found that aerial images of a purported grave site corroborated real evidence and a 
forensic report showing disturbances in the grave soil demonstrated that the bodies of those 
massacred had been exhumed and moved to secondary grave sit es.135 
 
C.5. Insufficient authentication goes to the weight of aerial and satellite 
images rather than their admissibility.  
Keywords: probative value; admissibility; relevance; authentication; chain of custody  
Manipulation and distortion of aerial and satellite images do not necessarily affect their 
admissibility.136 The ICTY in Popovi ć disagreed with the Defence’s argument that the aerial 
images in that case could not be admitted because their dates had been removed, they ‘were 
misrepresented to the Uni ted Nations, the Security Council, and the public’ as proving the 
purported existence of weapons of mass destruction was unrelated to the case, and there were 
differences in corroborating testimony:137 such reasons go to weight (i.e., probative value) 
rathe r than the criteria necessary for admission.138 
 Method of Creation.  Lack of information regarding the method of creation of aerial and 
satellite images does not necessarily impair their probative value. Pursuant to Rule 70 of the 
ICTY Rules of Procedure and Evidence ,139 a party may provide information to the Prosecutor 
on a confidential basis. Where evidence is lacking as to the origin of aerial and sate llite images,

","assistant: Step 1: Identify the relevant information in the context that directly answers the question. The question asks about the type of evidence that can be corroborated by aerial and satellite images. This information is found in the first paragraph of the context.

Step 2: Extract the necessary information. The context states, ##begin_quote##""Aerial and satellite images can be used to corroborate other evidence such as forensic evidence, witness testimony, and the reliability of intercept communications.""##end_quote## It also provides an example where ##begin_quote##""aerial images of a purported grave site corroborated real evidence and a forensic report showing disturbances in the grave soil demonstrated that the bodies of those massacred had been exhumed and moved to secondary grave sites.""##end_quote##

Step 3: Formulate the answer based on the extracted information. The types of evidence that can be corroborated by aerial and satellite images include forensic evidence, witness testimony, and the reliability of intercept communications. An example of this is when aerial images were used to corroborate real evidence and a forensic report in a case involving a grave site.

44 Disclosure of Related Documents.  Pursuant to Rule 71(B) of the IRMCT Rules of 
Procedure and Evidence , the Prosecutor shall permit the Defence to inspect any books, 
documents, photographs, and tangible objects in the Prosecutor’s custo dy or control which are 
material to the preparation of the defence or intended for use at trial.239 This establishes the 
scope of the Prosecutor’s disclosure obligations. The MICT Single Judge in Turinabo et al  held 
that in addition to the CDRs, the followi ng related documents fell within the scope of the 
disclosure obligation: correspondence with the Rwandan authorities in relation to the 
identification and transmission of intercepts, including requests for assistance from the 
Rwandan authorities, written f ollow -ups, the responses thereto, and the clearance letter 
through which the Rwandan authorities consented to the disclosure of the call logs, as these 
documents could be relevant to the Defence’s investigation regarding the origin, nature, or the 
timing o f the call logs and thus assist their preparation.240 
 Material Outside Scope of Disclosure Obligation.  Pursuant to Rule 76(A) of the IRMCT 
Rules of Procedure and Evidence , reports, memoranda, or other internal documents prepared 
by a party in connection with the investigation, preparation, or presen tation of the case are not 
subject to disclosure obligations.241 The MICT Single Judge in Turinabo et al  decided that 
internal notes and mission reports concerning the intercepted communications were not 
subject to disclosure where the Defence has not demon strated that any of the information 
sought might prima facie be exculpatory.242

53 Open Source Audio Recordings of Media Broadcasts.  The ICC Trial Chamber in Bemba  
held that where the audio recording of an interview lacks a date and contains no questions, the 
tendering party must provide sufficient information to identify the recorded voi ce and ‘to 
confirm the date, circumstances and context in which the recording was created’.285 In the 
absence of such information, the ICC Trial Chamber found that it could not afford probative 
value to audio recording CAR -DEF-0001 -0830, which the Prosecuti on alleged was a 
monologue of the Secretary -General of the Movement for the Liberation of the Congo.286 
Moreover, in the context of the ICTY proceedings against Mladić , and  pursuant to Rule 
89(D) of the ICTY Rules of Procedure and Evidence ,287 ‘[the] Chamber may exclude evidence 
if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the need to ensure a f air trial’. 
Nevertheless, open source audio recordings may be admitted if counsel show with sufficient 
clarity and specificity the relevance and probative value of these documents, and how they fit 
into the case.288 In Mladi ć, the ICTY Prosecution requested  the admission of open source local 
and international radio news reports from the bar table.289 The Defence objected to their 
admission on the grounds that they originated from an open source and as such the author was 
unknown, rendering the Defence unable to challenge the content of the material, and that it 
was unclear whether the source heard the information from others.290 The ICTY Trial Chamber 
found that the general Defence submissions in relation to the origin of these documents were 
insufficient to su ccessfully challenge their probative value, or preclude admission pursuant to 
Rule 89(D) of the Rules. Having considered the documents in this category, the Chamber was 
satisfied that the Prosecution had shown with sufficient clarity and specificity the re levance 
and probative value of each of these documents, and how they fit into its case.291

20 B. Photographs  
Definition  
Photographs are widely used within international criminal proceedings, but despite their 
common usage, courts and tribunals have not undertaken to provide a widespread defi nition 
at this stage. Photographs often fall under the broad definition of documentary evidence which 
includes ‘anything in which information of any description is recorded’91 and can be defined as 
‘picture[s] made using a camera, in which an image is focu sed on to light -sensitive material and 
then made visible and permanent by chemical treatment, or stored digitally’.92 
 
B.1. The Court can make an inference from the content of a photograph to 
the extent that it allows the Court to make a definite finding.  
Keywo rds: relevance; inferences  
This Guideline is derived from the ICC’s treatment of video evidence, but it can reasonably be 
applied to photographs as well. Caution should be exercised when considering a photograph 
since differences in personal perception can cause difficulties in making a definite finding.93 
The Court will rely on the photograph only to the extent that it can make such a definite 
finding.94 The ICC Trial Chamber in Lubanga found that a reliable distinction can be drawn 
between i ndividuals of different ages, based solely on the individuals’ appearance.95 Pursuant 
to Rule 63(4) of the ICC Rules of Procedure and Evidence , there is no strict legal requirement 
that a photograph has to be corroborated by other evidence for the Court to be able to rely on 
it and establish a specific fact.96

","assistant: Step 1: Identify the key points in the question. The question asks about factors that can increase the reliability of intercepted radio communications in a court case.

Step 2: Look for relevant information in the context. The context provides several factors that can increase the reliability of intercepted radio communications in a court case.

Step 3: Extract the relevant information from the context. 

##begin_quote##
""Intercepts are more likely to be deemed reliable by a Court when they can be authenticated, cross checked and corroborated through internal means such as multiple operators intercepting the same message.""
##end_quote##

##begin_quote##
""Consequently, where corroborating evidence is of a high level of documentable detail that could not have been completely manufactured, it is more likely the intercept evidence will be accepted as reliable.""
##end_quote##

##begin_quote##
""An intercept whose authenticity cannot be confirmed with certainty may nevertheless be admitted if a forensic report states that there are no traces of it having been tampered with.""
##end_quote##

Step 4: Formulate the answer based on the extracted information. The factors that can increase the reliability of intercepted radio communications in a court case include the authentication, cross-checking, and corroboration of the intercepts by multiple operators, the presence of high-level corroborating evidence that could not have been completely manufactured, and a forensic report stating that there are no traces of tampering with the intercepts.

33 the Trial Chamber may neverthe less take a comprehensive approach and admit them: in Mladi ć, 
it found that the intercepts related to the Srebrenica section of the Prosecution’s case, some 
of which were ambiguous on their own, constituted a contemporaneous, chronological record 
of events  on the ground and demonstrated a network of interaction and exchange of 
information concerning the alleged crimes charged in the Indictment.173 As a result, they were 
relevant. However, the weight the Chamber will ultimately attribute to every individual 
intercept it admits into evidence can only fully be assessed following further contextualization, 
for example by witnesses who were either participants in the intercepts or otherwise have a 
sufficient basis to provide such contextual testimony.174 In their a bsence, it appears that the 
intercepts will merely be afforded less weight, but still admitted. Moreover, it remains open to 
the Defence to challenge their authenticity.175 
Witness Testimony.  Judges may have a prima facie basis to admit intercepts and their  
transcripts where their authenticity and chain of custody can be demonstrated through witness 
testimony by the person who intercepted the communication. The witness must be able to 
testify that they recognise the intercept and its transcripts, and that th ey are able to identify it 
as the same one they had recorded.176 The ICTR Trial Chamber in Renzaho  found that the tape 
of an intercepted phone call (recorded by a journalist),177 on which the accused allegedly talked 
of ‘extermination’, could be admitted. The Defence argued that it was not known how the 
intercept was made and where it originally came from, and this therefore cast ‘doubt and 
ambiguity as to the authenticity of [the ] tapes’.178 In response, the ICTR Trial Chamber 
considered the testimony of the journalist, who testified that he recognised the intercept and 
its transcript when this was shown to him during examination -in-chief, and he was also able to 
identify that the intercept in question was the same as the one he had made in 1994. The Court 
considered that the testimony provided a prima facie basis to admit the tape and the 
transcripts.179

15 in Karemera et al  admitted videos which depicted violence and killings in Rwanda, but 
disregarded any accompanying comments made by journalists in the videos.61 
Nevertheless, caution should be exercised when assess ing a video since differences in 
personal perception may cause difficulties in reaching a definite finding.62 It may not be 
possible to make a definite finding if a subject appears too briefly in the video.63 The ICC Trial 
Chamber in Lubanga  was not able t o make a definite finding on the depiction of alleged child 
soldiers in a video where children who could be under the age of 15 appeared for just two 
seconds in a video.64  
However, allowing for a wide margin of error, it is possible to make definite findings. 
The Court will rely on the video only to the extent that it can make a definite finding.65 The ICC 
Trial Chamber in Lubanga  relied on video evidence concerning child soldiers only to the extent 
that it could make a definite finding that it depicted children who were clearly under the age 
of 15.66 A negative finding based on what was not shown in the video can also, in principle, be 
substantiated.67 Pursuant to Rule 63(4) of the ICC Rules of Procedure and Evidence , there is 
no strict legal requirement that the video has to be corroborated by other evidence for the 
Court to be able to rely on it and establish a specific fact.68 The ICC Appeals  Chamber in

the age of individuals based on the video evidence provided, given the absence of

Definition  
Call Data Records (CDRs) are defined as metadata that do not contain the content of any 
communications, but solely provide information about them, such as the source and 
destination phone numbers, date and time of phone calls and text messages, the type of 
communication, the duration of phone calls, the IMEI number225 of the handset relevant to the 
communications, and the cell sectors226 engaged at the beginning and end of a  call.227 
Call Sequence Tables (CSTs) are spreadsheets or database tables which organise and 
present relevant information from the CDRs into an intelligible and readable format without 
altering the content of the CDRs.228 
 
E.1. The relevant data should be extract ed from Call Data Records and 
presented in a readable format as Call Sequence Tables . 
Keywords: extraction; format  
Call Data Records ( CDRs ) are themselves voluminous and, without extraction of the relevant 
data into a readable format, meaningless.229 The STL Trial Chamber in Ayyash et al  declined to 
admit CDRs given that they were so voluminous and unwieldy, comprising billions of entries, 
and unreadable in their raw form as long strings of numbers and symbols.230

eavesdropping  on an enemy’s telephone calls during the course of a war’ was ‘certainly not

determined it was not ‘antithetical to and certainly would not seriously damage the integrity  of

particularly in light of the fact that the journalist testified that he had actually obtained consent 
from the RPF soldiers to make recordings of the conversati ons they were allegedly able to hear

applicable to calls intercepted in April 1994, when the recording was made, and hence whether 
the interception was illegal, the ICTR Trial Chamber considered that this ‘would not in itself 
lead to exclusion [of the intercepts] under human rights law or Tribunal case law’.211 
 Similarly, the ICTY Trial Chamber in Brdjanin  found that it could admit intercepts that 
the Defence alleged ha d been obtained illegally in contravention of domestic law.212 While 
admission of illegally obtained intercepts might indeed contravene Rule 95 of the ICTY Rules 
of Procedure and Evidence  (which is identical to Rule 95 of the ICTR Rules of Procedure and

intercepted, such a right is not absolute.214 It may be derogated from in times of emergency: 
that the intercepts had be en obtained during the course of a war ‘is an example par 
excellence ’.215 The ICTY Trial Chamber asserted that ‘communications intercepted during an 
armed conflict are not as such subject to exclusion under Rule 95 and should therefore be 
admitted’.216 Inter cepts obtained illegally are not, a priori, inadmissible: the manner and

Where shortcomings or flaws exist, intercepts can still be considered reliable and admitted on 
account of a detailed explanation of the process of interception and analysi s of the intercepted 
evidence.193 The Pre -Trial Chamber of the ICC in Ongwen found intercepted radio 
communications were reliable194 even though the intercepts were flawed due to shortcomings 
in the circumstances regarding the creation of the intercepts, for  example that they had been 
recorded over 10 years ago with rudimentary equipment.195 The Prosecution acknowledged 
these flaws and gave ‘a detailed explanation of how the intercepts were acquired and studied 
[…] and also provided statements of nine witnesse s involved at all levels of the […] interception 
operations’, leading the Chamber to admit the evidence.196 
Technical Irregularities.  When evaluating the reliability of audio recordings, the 
technical irregularities in recording conversations, albeit potent ially significant, are not of such 
a scale as to exclude the evidence from the outset but rather warrant a case -by-case

20 B. Photographs  
Definition  
Photographs are widely used within international criminal proceedings, but despite their 
common usage, courts and tribunals have not undertaken to provide a widespread defi nition 
at this stage. Photographs often fall under the broad definition of documentary evidence which 
includes ‘anything in which information of any description is recorded’91 and can be defined as 
‘picture[s] made using a camera, in which an image is focu sed on to light -sensitive material and

B.1. The Court can make an inference from the content of a photograph to 
the extent that it allows the Court to make a definite finding.  
Keywo rds: relevance; inferences  
This Guideline is derived from the ICC’s treatment of video evidence, but it can reasonably be 
applied to photographs as well. Caution should be exercised when considering a photograph 
since differences in personal perception can cause difficulties in making a definite finding.93 
The Court will rely on the photograph only to the extent that it can make such a definite 
finding.94 The ICC Trial Chamber in Lubanga found that a reliable distinction can be drawn 
between i ndividuals of different ages, based solely on the individuals’ appearance.95 Pursuant 
to Rule 63(4) of the ICC Rules of Procedure and Evidence , there is no strict legal requirement 
that a photograph has to be corroborated by other evidence for the Court to be able to rely on 
it and establish a specific fact.96

Witness Testimony.  Judges may have a prima facie basis to admit intercepts and their  
transcripts where their authenticity and chain of custody can be demonstrated through witness 
testimony by the person who intercepted the communication. The witness must be able to 
testify that they recognise the intercept and its transcripts, and that th ey are able to identify it

of an intercepted phone call (recorded by a journalist),177 on which the accused allegedly talked 
of ‘extermination’, could be admitted. The Defence argued that it was not known how the 
intercept was made and where it originally came from, and this therefore cast ‘doubt and

","assistant: Reasoning:

The context provides information on the conditions that must be met for an audio recording to be considered as evidence in the ICC Trial Chamber, according to the Bemba case. 

Firstly, the audio recording must have sufficient information to identify the recorded voice and to confirm the date, circumstances, and context in which the recording was created. This is stated in the context as ##begin_quote##""where the audio recording of an interview lacks a date and contains no questions, the tendering party must provide sufficient information to identify the recorded voice and ‘to confirm the date, circumstances and context in which the recording was created’.""##end_quote##

Secondly, the probative value of the audio recording must not be substantially outweighed by the need to ensure a fair trial. This is mentioned in the context as ##begin_quote##""‘[the] Chamber may exclude evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the need to ensure a fair trial’.""##end_quote##

Lastly, the counsel must show with sufficient clarity and specificity the relevance and probative value of the audio recording, and how it fits into the case.

53 Open Source Audio Recordings of Media Broadcasts.  The ICC Trial Chamber in Bemba  
held that where the audio recording of an interview lacks a date and contains no questions, the 
tendering party must provide sufficient information to identify the recorded voi ce and ‘to 
confirm the date, circumstances and context in which the recording was created’.285 In the 
absence of such information, the ICC Trial Chamber found that it could not afford probative 
value to audio recording CAR -DEF-0001 -0830, which the Prosecuti on alleged was a 
monologue of the Secretary -General of the Movement for the Liberation of the Congo.286 
Moreover, in the context of the ICTY proceedings against Mladić , and  pursuant to Rule 
89(D) of the ICTY Rules of Procedure and Evidence ,287 ‘[the] Chamber may exclude evidence 
if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the need to ensure a f air trial’. 
Nevertheless, open source audio recordings may be admitted if counsel show with sufficient 
clarity and specificity the relevance and probative value of these documents, and how they fit 
into the case.288 In Mladi ć, the ICTY Prosecution requested  the admission of open source local 
and international radio news reports from the bar table.289 The Defence objected to their 
admission on the grounds that they originated from an open source and as such the author was 
unknown, rendering the Defence unable to challenge the content of the material, and that it 
was unclear whether the source heard the information from others.290 The ICTY Trial Chamber 
found that the general Defence submissions in relation to the origin of these documents were 
insufficient to su ccessfully challenge their probative value, or preclude admission pursuant to 
Rule 89(D) of the Rules. Having considered the documents in this category, the Chamber was 
satisfied that the Prosecution had shown with sufficient clarity and specificity the re levance 
and probative value of each of these documents, and how they fit into its case.291
